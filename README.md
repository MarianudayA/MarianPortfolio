# MarianPortfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, handcrafted with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript magic — and hosted on GitHub Pages. It showcases my work across branding, UI/UX, digital marketing, and web development. Each case study tells a story of transformation — designed, built, and led by me.
